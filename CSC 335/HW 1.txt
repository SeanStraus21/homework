List five responsibilities of a database-management system. For each responsibility, explain the problems that would arise if the responsibility were not discharged.

Answer:
	1. provide abstract view of data: if data were provided in its raw form, it would become inconvenient for ordinary users to view. It would also become more difficult to implement security systems.
	2. eliminate data redundancy: if the same information is stored in multiple physical locations, this could potentially lead to inconsistencies and anomalous behavior.
	3. insure atomicity in transactions: if transactions are not atomic, then in the case of a systems failure may result in an incomplete transaction, resulting in errors.
	4. limit access to data depending on the user: it is frequently undesirable for a single user to have access to all the information in a database. Not only is some information meant to be classified, but most users are only interested in a small segment of data.
	5. provide structure for storing data: if the data is not stored in a well-designed data-structure, searching for certain pieces of data would be much slower than neccessary.

1.12
Explain what problems are caused by the design of the table in Figure 1.4.

Answer:
	There are too many fields crammed into one table, leading to data redundancies. For instance, department budget and building are repeated each time a teacher is listed who belongs to a department. The table should be broken down into two smaller tables.

2.9
Consider the bank database of Figure 2.15.
a. What are the appropriate primary keys?
b. Given your choice of primary keys, identify appropriate foreign keys.

Answer:
	a. branch_name*,customer_name*,loan_number,loan_number,account_number,account_number
	b.none,none,branch_name,customer_name,branch_name,customer_name



2.10
Consider the advisor relation shown in Figure 2.8, with s_id as the primary
key of advisor. Suppose a student can have more than one advisor. Then,
would s_id still be a primary key of the advisor relation? If not, what should
the primary key of advisor be?

answer:(s_id,t_id)


Draw a schema diagram for the database in Figure 2.14, page 53 of the textbook.

*= primary key
	EMPLOYEE:		WORKS:				COMPANY:
	person_name*--->person_name*		city
	street			company_name<-------company_name*
	city			salary
