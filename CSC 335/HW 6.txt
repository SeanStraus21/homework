1. Use Armstrong’s axioms to prove the soundness of the decomposition rule.
	the decomposition rule states:if X → YZ, then X → Y and X → Z
	by the reflexive axiom, since Y and Z are included in YZ, YZ → Y and YZ → Z
	by transitivity, X → YZ, and YZ → Y and Z, X → Y and X → Z
	

2. Consider the following set F of functional dependencies on the relation
			schema r (A, B, C, D, E, F ):
			A → BCD
			BC → DE
			B → D
			D → A
	a) Compute B+
		B
		BD // B → D
		ABD //BD → A
		ABCD //ABD → BCD
		ABCDE //ABCD → DE
		no further changes can be made, so
		B+ = ABCDE
	b) Prove (using Armstrong’s axioms) that AF is a superkey.
		AF is a superkey if AF → ABCDEF
		by reflexivity, AF → AF
		A → BC and BC → DE, so by transitivity A → DE
		A → BCD A → BCDE, so by augmentation AF → ABCDEF
		therefore AF is a superkey
	c) Compute a canonical cover for the above set of functional dependencies F ; give each step of your derivation with an explanation.
		r = (A,B,C,D,E,F);	F = {A → BCD, BC → DE, B → D, D → A} //starting values
		D is extraneous in A → BCD, so remove it {A → BC, BC → DE, B → D, D → A}
		D is extraneous in BC → DE, so remove it {A → BC, BC → E, B → D, D → A}
		no further change is possible, so
		canonical cover of F = {A → BC, BC → E, B → D, D → A}
	d) Give a 3NF decomposition of r based on the canonical cover.
		F+ = {A → BC, BC → E, B → D, D → A}
		The Tables Are:
		(A,BC)
		(BC,E)
		(B,D)
		(D,A)
		
	e) Give a BCNF decomposition of r using the original set of functional
	dependencies.
		r = (A,B,C,D,E,F);	F = {A → BCD, BC → DE, B → D, D → A}
		key = {A,F}
		A → BCD,
		A is not a superkey
		r[1] = (A,B,C,D)
		r = (A,B,C,E,F)
		BC → E, BC is not a superkey
		r[2] = (B,C,E)
		r = (A,F)
		(A,F) is a superkey
		the tables are:
		(A,B,C,D)
		(B,C,E)
		(A,F)
	f) Can you get the same BCNF decomposition of r as above, using the
	canonical cover?
		yes
